I like to travel, my favourite country I've visited is Peru. There i did a 4 day hike through the jungle to see Machu Picchu. During the hike I saw the clearest night sky I've ever seen and I can still recall all the stars in the night. It was a super cool experience.

Here are my favourite things in my room and my biggest inspiration for everything right now.

I won them in a claw machine arcade :)
